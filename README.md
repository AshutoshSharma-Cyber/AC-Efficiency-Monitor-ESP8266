AC Cooling Efficiency Monitor — ESP8266 (IoT Project)

A smart IoT-based system using NodeMCU ESP8266, DHT22 temperature & humidity sensors, OLED display, ThingSpeak cloud dashboard and diagnose AC cooling performance in real-time.

This system detects cooling inefficiency, clogged filters, condenser issues, compressor failure, humidity abnormalities, and outlet temperature anomalies — and notifies the user instantly.
